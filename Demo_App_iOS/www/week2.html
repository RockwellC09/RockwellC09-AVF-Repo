            <strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong><br>
            I think a good change I could make to my HTML is making it more responsive to the screen size. This way users, especially android users, are able to read all of the text without having to zoom in
            and scroll over everything. Also create a button that enables users to make the font larger for readability. Ultimately make my app more fluid and responsive would make it much more accessible.
            I hope that every app I make doesn't require users to have to zoom in and/or scroll from left to right in order to view the content. <br>

            <strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms)
            that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong><br>
            In my personal opinion and experiences it's very irritation to go to a website on my mobile phone and have to zoom in and as I read, have to scroll from left to right (as I mentioned above). This may
            seem like a small problem, but I tend to lose my place a lot while reading due to the fact that I have to scroll and can't see the entire paragraph at one time. This is a result of not making the website responsive
            to the users screen size and/or device. I believe this is a big deal when designing for mobile and can turn users away from exploring your website.<br>

            My iPhone has some pretty good accessibility options. Such as, VoiceOver, Zoom, and Large Text. I must admit this is my first time looking at my accessibility options; I should probably be taking advantage
            of the larger text option myself. My wife's Samsung Exhibit, running Android OS, only has two accessibility options, a screen reader and an option that allows users to end calls with the power button. I can
            tell there wasn't much thought put into accessibility by Samsung.<br>

            <strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong><br>
            Audible for iOS by audible.com is a great app for people who have poor vision or blind to be able to enjoy a great book hassle free. This is a great accessibility driven app and I am sure a great percentage of
            its users use it because of their vision issues. Google Translate for iOS i believe is a bit of a different take on accessibility, but in my opinion still should be in the conversation. An app that enables users to
            understand and write in another language can be a lifesaver. I chose this app because I actually have half Filipino siblings and a Filipino step-mom, so me being able to communicate in her language as a way
            of returning the favor of her communicating in mine is a huge weight off of her shoulders.<br>
