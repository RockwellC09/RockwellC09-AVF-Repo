            <strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br>
            I believe Twitter, Facebook, etc. login spawned from the fact that every phone is that comes out is pretty much all touch screen. Although most people have mastered typing in little 4-inch
            screens it still doesn't compare to the mouse and keyboard on your laptop and desktop. So being able to press a button to login and/or sign up, relieves the stress of remembering emails
            and passwords, and cuts down on the amount of typing. Just as the scenario of buying a car, although a lot of paperwork is involved, all they require you to do is sign the dotted line. This is
            a means to make it less stressful and likely for you to feel overly committed. Which is to the salesman's benefit and not always yours ;). Back in the good old days, in tech years, (only about 4 years ago),
            where you have to sign up for things and give them all type of info, I believe it made users feel overly committed and less likely to dabble in website and apps. The benefits of it being used for payments,
            is it cuts down on typos and error. When dealing with payments, everything must be correct or it will be declined. I've had instance of me accidentally hitting an extra key when typing my name, and my order
            being canceled resulting in a few days delay on my shipment. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong><br>
            JSONP unlike JSON allows you to get data from other domains and is used in most popular APIs, which I noticed on programmable web. For me personally, I see it as a benefit do to my knowledge of JSON in
            general as a result of using it here in our apps at Full Sail. I feel comfortable using it and know how it works.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br>
            My favorite social network out right now is Instagram, which is a photo sharing service. Now that I have my new iPad, I don't have all the Instagram pictures within my local photo album. I was thinking, it would
            be neat to create an app that allows Instagram users to download their photos from Instagram to their new device(s) locally. Using the Instagram API, I could grab all the images for that giving users and enable
            them to go through a hand pick the images they want and download and save them to their device. This app would only require the storage native feature in order to access the phones photo album(s).<br><br>
            
            <strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong><br>
            The design of this app would be a photo grid style with some type of sleekly designed photo selection scheme. Maybe putting a grey tint over the selected photos as a way of letting the user know which photos
            they've selected to download. This app will ultimately enable those who get a new phone or iPad, to download all their favorite pictures and keep the locally on their device(s).<br><br>
            
            <strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br>
            One huge mistake I made in the past, was depending on the suggested completion time given on a project. Looking at a 6 hours estimated completion time, I figured I could start on the project a day before the
            due date and have plenty of time to finish. That particular project ended up taking me an hour before the time to turn it in to complete it and I still didn't get a chance to really look over my work as much as I wanted
            to. That taught me to always start on things ASAP and at the least, see what the project consist of so I can give myself a personal estimated time to finish. This was a lesson learned from me and has played a big role in my success here at Full Sail.<br><br>
