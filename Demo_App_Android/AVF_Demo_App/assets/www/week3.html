            <strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong><br>
            According to TopAppOFTheWorld.com, The number 1 paid app in the US is Temple Run Oz, which is in the game category. For Japan, the number one app is in the Music category, called AudioHacker.
            For Great Britain, it’s an app called WhatsApp, which is in the Social Networking Category.<br>

            <strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong><br>
            I believe each top selling app category being different shows that culture could possibly play a role in mobile sales. In the US, the age of mobile phone consumers is probably lower that any other place
            in the world. I have a 4-year-old nephew who has an android tablet. This is probably why our top selling app is in the game category. Japan's top app is an mp3 downloader app, which can be argued to
            be a more teen and young adult based market. This is based off of youth being the biggest consumers of music, which will likely reflect the app revenue making music the top category. In Great Britain,
            WhatsApp is the top app, which is a social networking app that allows users to send free test messages to any smartphone. The fact that people are paying for this app, make me wonder if the availability
            of unlimited messaging is as common there as it is here in the US. Unlimited messaging is the norm, and I don't see too many people trying to pay to text when it's already unlimited on your plan. So WhatsApp
            being their top selling app can be looked at as a result of users mobile plans and messaging capabilities.<br>

            <strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong><br>
            According to websiteoptimization.com the US, cost about $10 per Mb/s, which is almost double Japan, which is about $4.80 per Mb/s. Great Britain comes in even lower at about $4 per Mb/s. I believe this
            impacts development a lot. Since the US is much more expensive I believe as a developer, you will need to consider that people will likely have lower speeds in the US market. So when making you app, it would
            be wise to find ways to cut back on data usage when it comes to the amount you're trying to transfer at a one time. This could turn away users simply be being too slow. Whereas in Japan, and Great Britain, although
            you still want to keep it as fast as possible, their speed will likely be a bit fast due to the lower cost.<br>

            <strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong><br>
            Just as I mentioned before, about the 4-year-old nephew having a tablet. I believe this is the start of a big boom of young consumers. I hope to create an app that targets those between the ages of 4 and about 8,
            something educational and fun. The game category being the top selling category makes me think a game would be the best approach on educating youth and combining the two would be a huge hit. So US, would
            be the market and education and games would be the category for my app.<br>
